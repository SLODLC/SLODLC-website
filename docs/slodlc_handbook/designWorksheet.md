_Work with your final prioritized User Journeys and Expectations list from SLODLC Discovery Worksheet. For each item on the list define meaningful SLIs using the SLI/SLO Specification Template._

_Combine all your filed SLI/SLO templates into one SLI/SLO Repository (one file with filled tables or one folder with separate files - one SLI one file; one website, anything that works for you at least you will ensure data completeness; more about SLI/SLO Repository you will find in SLODLC Handbook)._

_Type any notes or remarks which might be helpful in the future; optional - capture lessons learned._

...


# 2.Define Achievable SLOs


## 2.1.Input

_Work with each of your defined SLI captured in SLI/SLO Repository - Define Achievable SLOs (one to many per one SLI - if needed). Updated SLI/SLO Repository._

_Type any notes or remarks which might be helpful in the future; optional - capture lessons learned._

...


## 2.2.Risk Assessment Exercise

_Risk assessment will help you to figure out what's achievable, what's aspirational, what the mitigations could be, and will help build a reliability roadmap. For comprehensive risk assessment use Risk Analysis Template made by Google; it is a free, public tool based on years-long SRE practices, which can be found under the link: https://goo.gl/bnsPj7._

_Type any notes or remarks which might be helpful in the future; optional - capture lessons learned._
