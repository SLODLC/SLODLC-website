# Historical Reports

Reports in Nobl9 allow you to get data-driven insights into your service level objectives. Using Reports, you can resolve critical questions for your business: for instance, whether to focus on the development of new features or manage your technical debt.

## Report Types

To run a report, navigate to the Reports page in the main navigation menu. You can use the following reports:

* **SLO History (Rolling)** — shows the performance of the selected time period of your SLO.

* **SLO History (Calendar-Aligned)** — shows the performance aligned to calendars for business reporting needs.

* **SLO Error Budget Status** — shows the percentage of errors in the selected time period.

* **Resource Usage Summary** — shows the number of resources configured in Nobl9 and the peak usage
