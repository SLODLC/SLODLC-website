  #### I receive no data from my <code>data source</code>. How is that treated by Nobl9?
  </summary>
  <div>
      <ul>
        <li>When there is no data, no results get produced. Currently, customers are not notified when the data inflow is stopped.</li>
        <li>Depending on the budgeting method, no data is treated differently:</li>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Occurrences method</b> - no data means that there were no good and no total events, which in turn doesnâ€™t impact the ratio of good to total events.</li>
        <li><b>Timeslices method</b> - minutes without any data are counted as good minutes.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
