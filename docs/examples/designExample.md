# 1.Define meaningful SLIs


## 1.1.Input

_Work with your final prioritized User Journeys and Expectations list from SLODLC Discovery Worksheet. For each item on the list define meaningful SLIs using the SLI/SLO Specification Template._

_Combine all your filed SLI/SLO templates into one SLI/SLO Repository (one file with filled tables or one folder with separate files - one SLI one file; one website, anything that works for you at least you will ensure data completeness; more about SLI/SLO Repository you will find in SLODLC Handbook)._

_Type any notes or remarks which might be helpful in the future; optional - capture lessons learned._

New SLIs/SLOs definition - For each SLI we will work with one SLI/SLO Specification Template. All templates shall be stored in a dedicated directory called SLI/SLO Repository. Repository will be available to all employees and SLO adoption consultants working with us. EXAMPLE of 2. SLODLC Discovery Worksheet v2.3 was used as an input.

Links per SLI and related SLOs: SLI #1 -  SLI/SLO Specification

Lessons Learned - despite this being our first experience with repetitive SLODLC methodology we found it easy to discover and define SLOs. SLODLC process is guiding all precipitant leaving no place for misunderstanding.


# 2.Define Achievable SLOs


## 2.1.Input

_Work with each of your defined SLI captured in SLI/SLO Repository - Define Achievable SLOs (one to many per one SLI - if needed). Updated SLI/SLO Repository._

_Type any notes or remarks which might be helpful in the future; optional - capture lessons learned._

Links per SLI and related SLOs: SLI #1 -  SLI/SLO Specification - Achievable SLOs definition included


## 2.2.Risk Assessment Exercise

_Risk assessment will help you to figure out what's achievable, what's aspirational, what the mitigations could be, and will help build a reliability roadmap. For comprehensive risk assessment use Risk Analysis Template made by Google; it is a free, public tool based on years-long SRE practices, which can be found under the link: https://goo.gl/bnsPj7._

_Type any notes or remarks which might be helpful in the future; optional - capture lessons learned._
