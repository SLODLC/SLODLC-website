# 1.Implementation Readiness Checklist

_Check your readiness for SLI/SLO implementation. Both, Adoption Leader and selected The Team Representative (might be a SLO Owner defined per SLO) should approve that Discovery Phase and Design Phases are fully completed and Business Case documentation for SLO Adoption is valid and verified. SLI/SLO Repository should be established and populated with all data. Get approval through accepting this document/section, for instance by email._

_~~SLODLC Business Case Worksheet for SLO Adoption - Completed and Approved ~~_

_~~SLODLC Discovery Worksheet per Service - Completed and Approved~~_

_~~SLODLC Design Worksheet per Service - Completed and Approved~~_

_~~SLI/SLO Repository - Established~~_

All done/drafted, links provided in the document header. Conditionally approved (draft versions) - for now we assume this is sufficient as we are starting our first SLO adoption project.


# 2.Collect SLIs

_Work with each of your defined SLI captured in SLI/SLO Repository - note in the correct section._

_Type any notes or remarks which might be helpful in the future; optional - capture lessons learned. Updated SLI/SLO repository._

Links per SLI and related SLOs: SLI #1 -  SLI/SLO Specification - SLI and related SLOs are running on production

We will monitor SLI/SLOs in the first week, formal review is scheduled in a month's time.


# 3.Publish SLO Goals

Work with each of your defined SLI and SLOs captured in SLI/SLO Repository. Deploy them to production, publish for use and note this activity. Type any notes or remarks which might be helpful in the future; optional - capture lessons learned. Updated SLI/SLO repository.

Links per SLI and related SLOs: SLI #1 -  SLI/SLO Specification - SLI and related SLOs are running on production

We will monitor SLI/SLOs in the first week, formal review is scheduled in a month's time.


# 4.Enforce Error Budget Policy

_Work with each of your defined Error Budget Policy per SLO in SLI/SLO Repository. Plan how to enforce it and align with strategic communication within your organization._

_Type any notes or remarks which might be helpful in the future; optional - capture lessons learned. Updated SLI/SLO repository._

All Chatbot Stakeholders are informed about SLI/SLOs running. We will monitor SLI/SLOs in the first week and inform all Stakeholders in dedicated email communication. The formal review is scheduled this month with monthly cadence; all Stakeholders are invited to that meeting.


# 5.Prepare for Operations


## 5.1.Ensure SLI Data Cleanliness

_Overview of data correctness and data cleaning approach - will it be a dedicated procedure in place or SLO Adoption will benefit internal organizational standards which are already in place. Describe your approach and set appropriate checkpoints along Periodic Reviews._

Monitoring tool Admin will follow new procedures, related with new SLIs that are implemented in the production system. All data anomalies will be reported and consulted with the Chatbot Team.

No data issues while publishing new SLI/SLOs.


## 5.2.Establish Periodic Reviews

_SLI/SLO related reviews are a crucial element of SLO Adoption and Operations later on. Decide about a general approach to the reviews, set cadence, and scope. You might review SLI/SLOs along with Scrum ceremonies, you might have dedicated sessions weekly or monthly with different levels of details. This is the moment to add appropriate appointments in the Stakeholders calendar._

Links per SLI and related SLOs: SLI #1 -  SLI/SLO Specification - Reviews are planed

Project “SLOtisfactionary Chatbot” periodic review cycle (for Chatbot service) will be conducted monthly - we will align this with particular SLIs review schedules. Other services might have different reviews; it all depends on the SLI/SLO volume (will we have to do reviews per service, or we will be OK with one cycle).


## 5.3.Ensure SLO Visibility for SLO Insights

_Verify SLI/SLO visibility - are those accessible via different channels like dashboards, reports, visualized in other ways. Ensure flawless visibility for decision makers. Add appropriate insight activities for your planned periodic reviews._

All Chatbot Stakeholders are included in Alerting policies and they have "read-only" access to the SLO self-service platform (granted if needed on demand). With the first SLO we established the first SLO dashboard and special report for distribution.


# 6.Implementation Completeness Checklist

_Check your SLI/SLO implementation completeness - work with each of your defined SLI and SLOs captured in SLI/SLO Repository. Both, Adoption Leader and selected The Team Representative (might be a SLO Owner defined per SLO) should confirm completeness (SLI/SLO deployed and published). Get approval through accepting this document/section 5.1, for instance by email. List all SLIs/SLOs from SLI/SLO Repository - mark what is completed._
